Go in Action introduces the Go language, guiding you from inquisitive developer to Go guru. The book begins by introducing the unique features and concepts of Go. (We assume you're up to speed with another programming language already, so don't expect to spend a lot of time rehearsing stuff you already know.) Then, you'll get hands-on experience writing real-world applications including web sites and network servers, as well as techniques to manipulate and convert data at speeds that will make your friends jealous. In the final chapters, you'll go in-depth with the language and see the tricks and secrets that the Go masters are using to make their applications perform. For example, you'll learn to use Go's powerful reflection libraries and work with real-world examples of integration with C code.

### [Go Programming Blueprints - 2nd Ed.](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/go-programming-blueprints-second-edition)

### [Programming in Go: Creating Applications for the 21st Century](http://www.informit.com/store/programming-in-go-creating-applications-for-the-21st-9780321774637)

<img src="http://www.informit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=9780321774637&type=f" width="120px"/>

 Programming in Go brings together all the knowledge you need to evaluate Go, think in Go, and write high-performance software with Go. Summerfield presents multiple idiom comparisons showing exactly how Go improves upon older languages, calling special attention to Go’s key innovations. Along the way, he explains everything from the absolute basics through Go’s lock-free channel-based concurrency and its flexible and unusual duck-typing type-safe approach to object-orientation.


### [The Go Programming Language](http://gopl.io/)

<a href='http://gopl.io/'><img src="http://gopl.io/cover.png" width="120px"/></a>

*The Go Programming Language* is the authoritative resource for any
programmer who wants to learn Go.
Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan show you how to write clear
and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems.
The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with
any specific language, so you'll find it accessible whether you're
most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.

The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of
idiomatic Go code that cover the whole language, its most important libraries,
and a wide range of applications.
Source code is freely available for download from the book's companion web site
[gopl.io](http://gopl.io/),
and may be conveniently fetched, built, and installed using the `go get` command.

### [Introducing Go: Build Reliable, Scalable Programs](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-go/9781491941997/)
