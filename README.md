<img src="https://images.manning.com/120/160/resize/book/c/4037d5d-e5e5-49bf-a3c1-480be2907eaa/Kennedy-GO-HI.png" width="120px">

Go in Action introduces the Go language, guiding you from inquisitive developer to Go guru. The book begins by introducing the unique features and concepts of Go. (We assume you're up to speed with another programming language already, so don't expect to spend a lot of time rehearsing stuff you already know.) Then, you'll get hands-on experience writing real-world applications including web sites and network servers, as well as techniques to manipulate and convert data at speeds that will make your friends jealous. In the final chapters, you'll go in-depth with the language and see the tricks and secrets that the Go masters are using to make their applications perform. For example, you'll learn to use Go's powerful reflection libraries and work with real-world examples of integration with C code.

<img src="http://www.informit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=9780321774637&type=f" width="120px"/>

 Programming in Go brings together all the knowledge you need to evaluate Go, think in Go, and write high-performance software with Go. Summerfield presents multiple idiom comparisons showing exactly how Go improves upon older languages, calling special attention to Go’s key innovations. Along the way, he explains everything from the absolute basics through Go’s lock-free channel-based concurrency and its flexible and unusual duck-typing type-safe approach to object-orientation.


### [The Go Programming Language](http://gopl.io/)

<a href='http://gopl.io/'><img src="http://gopl.io/cover.png" width="120px"/></a>

*The Go Programming Language* is the authoritative resource for any
programmer who wants to learn Go.
Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan show you how to write clear
and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems.
The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with
any specific language, so you'll find it accessible whether you're
most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.

The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of
idiomatic Go code that cover the whole language, its most important libraries,
and a wide range of applications.
Source code is freely available for download from the book's companion web site
[gopl.io](http://gopl.io/),
and may be conveniently fetched, built, and installed using the `go get` command.

### [Introducing Go: Build Reliable, Scalable Programs](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-go/9781491941997/)

Solve your Go problems using a problem-solution approach. Each recipe is a self-contained answer to a practical programming problem in Go. Go Recipes contains recipes that deal with the fundamentals of Go, allowing you to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Other topics include working with data using modern NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and RethinkDB. The book provides in-depth guidance for building highly scalable backend APIs in Go for your mobile client applications and web client applications.

### [API Foundations in Go](https://leanpub.com/api-foundations)

With this book you'll learn to use Go, taking advantage of it's multi-threaded nature, and typed syntax. Starting your API implementation in Go is your first step towards what a rock solid API should be.

### [Building Distributed Applications in Gin](https://www.packtpub.com/product/building-distributed-applications-in-gin/9781801074858)

<img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781801074858/cover/smaller" width="120px"/>

Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework used to build web applications and microservices in Go. This book is designed to teach you the ins and outs of the Gin framework with the help of practical examples.

You’ll start by exploring the basics of the Gin framework, before progressing to build a real-world RESTful API. Along the way, you’ll learn how to write custom middleware and understand the routing mechanism, as well as how to bind user data and validate incoming HTTP requests. The book also demonstrates how to store and retrieve data at scale with a NoSQL database such as MongoDB, and how to implement a caching layer with Redis. Next, you’ll understand how to secure and test your API endpoints with authentication protocols such as OAuth 2 and JWT. Later chapters will guide you through rendering HTML templates on the server-side and building a frontend application with the React web framework to consume API responses. Finally, you’ll deploy your application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and learn how to automate the deployment process with a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

By the end of this Gin book, you will be able to design, build, and deploy a production-ready distributed application from scratch using the Gin framework.


### [Test-driven development with Go ](https://leanpub.com/golang-tdd) *Free*

A short guide to Test-driven development in golang. free to [read online](https://leanpub.com/golang-tdd/read).

### [Go programming language secure coding practices guide](https://checkmarx.gitbooks.io/go-scp/) *Free*

The main goal of this book is to help developers avoid common mistakes while at the same time, learning a new programming language through a "hands-on approach". This book provides a good level of detail on "how to do it securely" showing what kind of security problems could arise during development.
